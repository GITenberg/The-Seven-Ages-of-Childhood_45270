<div class='poem'>
Baby, of all mysterious things,<br />
You're stranger far than stars or kings.<br />
You stare superbly day by day,<br />
Nor let your large reserve give way.<br />
Unfathomable mysteries<br />
Lurk in your big, unseeing eyes,<br />
Making brave memories, and yet,<br />
Making them only to forget.<br />
But though reflectively you blink,<br />
Trying to make us think you think,<br />
We know you cannot think or talk,<br />
You cannot run, you cannot walk;<br />
You little human mystery,<br />
You can't do anything but be.<br />
<br />
You small, content, safe-guarded thing,<br />
Nestling beneath your mother's wing.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>You're all so new; your roseleaf skin,<br />
Your dewy eyes and dimpled chin,<br />
Your pinch of hair and pound of flesh<br />
Are all so delicate and fresh.<br />
Then, Baby, every little while<br />
You cry. And then perhaps you smile.<br />
You cry without a bit of reason,<br />
You laugh both in and out of season;<br />
A wise proceeding, I suppose,<br />
If that is all the speech one knows.<br />
<br />
But sometimes do the dull hours drag?<br />
And sometimes does your patience flag?<br />
Long days and nights you must get through,<br />
Without a single thing to do.<br />
And though perhaps you see and hear,<br />
It means naught to your eye and ear.<br />
But, Baby, you don't seem to care,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>You hark at silence,&mdash;look at air!<br />
<br />
And in the stillness, or the dark,<br />
Absorbedly you look and hark.<br />
So, then, what difference can it make,<br />
Whether you are asleep or 'wake?<br />
You cannot think, and it would seem<br />
You do not know enough to dream.<br />
How can you dream, not knowing words?<br />
Or is it like the song of birds,<br />
Or scent of flowers, or sunshine bright,<br />
Or South breeze on a summer's night?<br />
<br />
Perhaps your thoughts just flounder 'round<br />
In seas of color, waves of sound;<br />
In notions vague of shape or form.<br />
As,&mdash;Life is something soft and warm.<br />
Mother is just a happy place;<br />
Nurse is a sort of vacant space.<br />
And father is a kind of stuff,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>That's woolly, black and rather rough.<br />
<br />
And then some day into your eyes<br />
There comes a look exceeding wise.<br />
And then your brain begins to grow;<br />
You learn "How does the Kitty go?"<br />
You learn to "Love the Lambie Baa,"<br />
And "Make a Face at Grandmamma!"<br />
And then upon your own account<br />
You seem to learn a large amount,<br />
As you laboriously prove<br />
That your own fingers really move!<br />
And if you have accomplished this,<br />
And if you've learned "a Spanish kiss;"<br />
And if three times you've said "Goo&mdash;goo!"<br />
Why, that's a busy day for you!<br />

Queer, drifting fancies, vague and dim,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath his gold curls are hid.</span><br />
The kitchen steps appear to him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those of a pyramid.</span><br />
<br />
With mighty purpose in his mind,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He clambers up. And then,</span><br />
With purpose quite as well defined,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scrambles down again.</span><br />
<br />
Then, of all busy ones of earth,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Toilers beneath the sun,</span><br />
Working away for all they're worth,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He is the busiest one!</span><br />
<br />
Down in the sand he has to dig<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A hole, exceeding deep;</span><br />
And by its side, all smooth and big,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">He piles a lovely heap.</span><br />
<br />
With both hands then he scatters it<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Round the verandah floor;</span><br />
And when he's scattered every bit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He scoops it up once more.</span><br />
<br />
He has to watch the rainy drops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Drip, dripping from the wall;</span><br />
Then, quick as anything, he stops<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To go and roll his ball.</span><br />
<br />
Across the lawn he seems to see<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A funny little stick;</span><br />
So he must needs go hastily<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And give the thing a kick.</span><br />
<br />
The laughing sunshine sifts right through<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His mop of tangled curls;</span><br />
Turning it to a golden hue,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kinking it in twirls.</span><br />
</div>

<div class='poem'>
And then he hums with all his might<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A funny little song;</span><br />
Some of the notes are almost right,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And some are sort of wrong.</span><br />
<br />
Then he must watch a lady-bird<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That crawls across the floor;</span><br />
Then listen! for he <i>thinks</i> he heard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An awful lion roar!</span><br />
<br />
He has to stop and 'member things;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Once out at Gran'ma's house</span><br />
They was a birdy wiv red wings!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And kitty caught a mouse!</span><br />
<br />
"And then in Sunday-school one day,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The children all stood 'round,</span><br />
And sang a song 'bout why&mdash;delay,&mdash;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">It had a lovely sound."</span><br />
<br />
Whatever can, or can't be known,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He much desires to know;</span><br />
For suddenly his wonder-bone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has just begun to grow.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder what that birdy's at<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over to Gran'ma's house.</span><br />
I wonder why a kitty cat<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is 'llowed to catch a mouse.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why the doggie whines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I wonder why he does;</span><br />
I wonder why the dandylines<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">All turns to fuzzy-fuzz.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why my shadow-boy<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hops fast along as me;</span><br />
I wonder why my newest toy<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">So broken seems to be.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why they disappear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sharp and shiny tool;</span><br />
I wonder why my muvver dear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won't let me go to school.</span><br />
<br />
"I wonder why a deaded fly<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Won't ever come alive;</span><br />
I wonder why I'm only free,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">An Dorofy is five!"</span><br />
<br />
Each hour with wonder new is fraught;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Until he thinks so fast,</span><br />
He wonders what it was he thought<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When he was thinking last.</span><br />
<br />
Wondering, singing, 'membering,&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He learns anew each day,</span><br />
The world is but a bounding ball<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For him to kick in play.</span><br />

Next to the Epicure we turn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With a discerning taste in porridge;</span><br />
Yet careful, lest her mouth she burn,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the o'er hasty man from Norwich,</span><br />
For now, her judging powers have grown;<br />
She thinks with wisdom all her own.<br />
<br />
In tones that leave no room for doubt<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She intimates she is unable</span><br />
To eat her bread and milk without<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her bear and dolly on the table.</span><br />
And nurse, because of her insistence,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Follows the line of least resistance.<br />
<br />
She does not want a nice clean dress;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's very, very sure she doesn't!</span><br />
She wants to go to Grandma's,&mdash;yes!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She wasn't naughty,&mdash;no, she wasn't!</span><br />
And knows with wilful, shaking head,<br />
She does not want to go to bed!<br />
<br />
She doesn't want to speak her piece;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She doesn't want her hair all curly;</span><br />
She isn't Auntie's pressus niece!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She isn't mother's darling girlie!</span><br />
Then suddenly, a change pacific,&mdash;<br />
And her new mood is beatific!<br />

Cherubic smiles drive frowns away,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She vows that she loves evvybuddy!</span><br />
She <i>will</i> be goody-girl all day;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor get her shoes and stockings muddy.</span><br />
She will not go outside the yard;<br />
And she "loves muvver awful hard!"<br />
<br />
Sometimes the martyr mood appears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She's good in meek, submissive fashion;</span><br />
Reproachful eyes show signs of tears,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And red cheeks hint a stifled passion.</span><br />
She wonders, "when she gets to heaven,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>If children go to bed at seven!"<br />
<br />
She favors games of "let's p'tend,"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with an energy unfailing,</span><br />
She plays the role of calling friend,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Dressed up in anything that's trailing.</span><br />
From, "Ding-a-ling!" "Come in"; a bow,&mdash;<br />
To, "Well, I must be going now."<br />
<br />
Her reasoning powers have come alive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her mind is rapidly awaking.</span><br />
The sharpest bargains she can drive,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conditions she is ever making.</span><br />
"I'll sing my song for uncle,&mdash;yes,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>If you will make my doll a dress."<br />
<br />
Her mind, obeying nature's law,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like morning-glory's soft unfolding,</span><br />
Fills with a deep, enchanting awe<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Those who are breathlessly beholding;</span><br />
And they exclaim, "Well, did you ever!"<br />
"She's surely going to grow up clever!"<br />
<br />
She dances down Life's primrose way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Unconscious of her faults and merits;</span><br />
The grown-ups watch her at her play,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And they opine that "she inherits</span><br />
Her mother's gentleness; but still<br />
She seems to have her father's will."<br />

In the soft soil of little lives<br />
Affection quickly springs and thrives<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And grows like anything;</span><br />
Its tiny tendrils Love puts out,<br />
Not knowing what it's all about,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But glad to smile and sing.</span><br />
<br />
Perhaps it is a favorite doll,<br />
Often the raggedest of all,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That bids affection start.</span><br />
Unstinted love is gladly poured<br />
Upon the dolly so adored<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">By little Tenderheart.</span><br />
<br />
Now love grows very fast, and so<br />
The little heart will overflow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And love will run to waste;</span><br />
It must needs fall on this or that,&mdash;<br />
The dog, the baby or the cat;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Quite Catholic its taste.</span><br />
<br />
Perhaps a schoolmate gets a share;<br />
The little girl with braided hair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That sits next in the class;</span><br />
The one with wide, pathetic eyes,<br />
Blue as the warm midsummer skies,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A timid little lass.</span><br />

A bashful glance,&mdash;a furtive look,&mdash;<br />
Some words about a lesson book;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then a smile or two.</span><br />
Then,&mdash;"You're the nicest girl I know!"<br />
And, "So are you!" "I love you so."<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, "So do I love you!"</span><br />
<br />
Together arm in arm they walk,<br />
They do not care for others' talk,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Nor with the others play;</span><br />
In softest whispers they impart<br />
The secrets of each little heart,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Intimate friends are they.</span><br />
<br />
And yet, though fair and sweet the fruits,<br />
So fragile are affection's roots,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A trifle works them ill;</span><br />
A single hasty word, or curt,<br />
The little tendrils oft will hurt;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A frown perhaps may kill.</span><br />
<br />
"She told me what you said 'bout me!"<br />
"I think she's mean as she can be!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"I'm mad at you! So there!"</span><br />
"I'll never speak to you again!"<br />
"All right, Miss Meany, don't you then!<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">You needn't think I care!"</span><br />
<br />
And then, just as the big tears start,<br />
Homeward runs little Broken-heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And to her own room flies;</span><br />
"Dolly, my darling dolly, pet,<br />
You love me, dear, you love me yet!"<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She whispers with wet eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Ah, human love brings but unrest,<br />
Once more she catches to her breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The love that cannot fail;</span><br />
The love that makes her heartache cease,<br />
The love that brings a soothing peace,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">No other can avail.</span><br />
<br />
Instinctive love, that can't be taught,<br />
That giveth all and asketh naught,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Reigns in one heart alone.</span><br />
Its own reward it can create,<br />
It makes the heart inanimate<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Responsive to her own.</span><br />

Nothing is quite so hard, I think,<br />
As drawing maps with pen and ink.<br />
You dot the cities, every one,<br />
And make long lines where rivers run.<br />
<br />
And every single coasting line<br />
Must wave in curves as fine as fine.<br />
The rivers wriggle up and down<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>Across the green and through the brown;<br />
<br />
You have to measure all the while,&mdash;<br />
A half an inch is 'most a mile.<br />
I do think maps are awful queer,<br />
They seem to bring the whole world here.<br />
<br />
Why, as I sit here in my chair,<br />
I see the countries everywhere.<br />
I see across to far Japan,<br />
With funny people, like a fan.<br />

All red and purple clothes they wear,<br />
And knobby hatpins in their hair,<br />
And flowers and trees of simple kind,<br />
And that big mountain far behind.<br />
<br />
Then, in the class, we have to give<br />
Description where the natives live.<br />
The countries that are colored pink<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>Are where the natives live, I think.<br />
<br />
The people that live there, I'm sure<br />
Must be extremely sad and poor,<br />
With only rice and things to eat,<br />
And not a single shady street.<br />
<br />
I wonder if they ever think<br />
They live in countries colored pink.<br />
<br />
But drawing maps,&mdash;that isn't all;<br />
I was promoted in the Fall,<br />
And now I've lots of bigger books.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Reading is harder than it looks.<br />
<br />
You have to say your words just so,<br />
You mustn't read too fast or slow.<br />
It 'stracts you so, you can't find out,<br />
Sometimes, what stories are about.<br />
<br />
But reader stories, anyway,<br />
Are never very glad or gay;<br />
They're mostly 'bout some noble deed,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>With fine, high-sounding words to read.<br />
<br />
And though it sounds quite loud and grand,<br />
It's pretty hard to understand.<br />
But Friday afternoon's the time!<br />
We all speak pieces made of rhyme.<br />
<br />
Next week, mine is the loveliest one,<br />
About "The South Wind and the Sun."<br />
It has such soft and singing words,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>Like "lily-bells, and humming birds."<br />
<br />
The south wind and the sun, you see,<br />
Were comrades, just like May and me.<br />
And they went wandering all about,<br />
Just full of laugh, and gleeful shout.<br />
<br />
Dancing all springy on their toes;<br />
Wait! This is the way it goes:<br />
"Arm in arm they went together,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Over heights of morning haze.<br />
<br />
"Over slanting slopes of lawn,<br />
They went on and on and on,<br />
Where the daisies looked like star-tracks,<br />
Trailing up and down the dawn."<br />
<br />
Don't you think that is nice to say<br />
Upon a breezy, shiny day?<br />
Some poets just know how to write,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>The loveliest pieces to recite;<br />
<br />
So many that I'd love to speak,<br />
And just one Friday in each week!<br />
But then I study other things,&mdash;<br />
The Civil War, and Saturn's rings,&mdash;<br />
<br />
I have to study hard, for, oh!<br />
There is so much I want to know.<br />
There's lots of knowledge, I suppose,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>More even than my Grandpa knows.<br />
<br />
I look ahead, and seem to see<br />
That knowledge waiting there for me.<br />
I think, when I grow big and tall,<br />
I prob'ly shall have learned it all.<br />

When all the others are at play,<br />
Sometimes I like to go away<br />
And sit beneath the willow tree,<br />
And wait for thought to come to me.<br />
<br />
It's just the dearest quiet spot,<br />
Where I can think as well as not;<br />
And little breezes softly blow,<br />
That seem to make my feelings grow.<br />
<br />
And all the sunny, golden air<br />
Is full of living, everywhere.<br />
Then, with a happy little sound,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>The branches murmur all around,<br />
<br />
So close, I scarcely can see through<br />
The willow leaves against the blue.<br />
Yet far less clearly can I see<br />
Through tangled thoughts that come to me.<br />
<br />
There seem to be, on every side,<br />
Doors suddenly flung open wide;<br />
Leading to places strange and fair;<br />
I want to go,&mdash;yet don't quite dare.<br />
<br />
I've been a little girl so long,<br />
That, somehow, it seems almost wrong<br />
To think how grown-up I shall be<br />
In days that have to come to me.<br />

But likely I'd say no, I guess,<br />

I'll have a softly trailing gown,&mdash;<br />
Blue velvet edged with snow-white down.<br />
But, such a robe as that to wear,<br />

The year was at its very Spring,<br />
A dawning glory filled the air;<br />
So marvelous, it seemed to bring<br />
A sense of something strange and fair.<br />
<br />
Slowly along the blossomed lane,<br />
Strolled, wondering, a girl and boy,<br />
Happy,&mdash;yet powerless to explain<br />
Whence came this new and mystic joy.<br />
<br />
The pinky blooms upon the trees<br />
Swam in a fragrant, rosy blur;<br />
And suddenly he knew that these<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>Had not the loveliness of her.<br />
<br />
The knowledge made his heart stand still;<br />
Exquisite fancies filled his mind;<br />
He felt a power to voice at will<br />
Speech of the most exalted kind.<br />
<br />
Poetic lines sang in his ears,<br />
Strophes ran riot in his head;<br />
And, almost with a thrill of tears,<br />
"It&mdash;it's a lovely day!" he said.<br />
<br />
Unconsciously her hand met his;<br />
His simple nearness seemed to bless;<br />
She only murmured, "Yes, it is!"<br />
But all the world breathed tenderness.<br />

Again the raptured silence fell;<br />
There was no need of spoken word;<br />
For each was conscious of the spell,<br />
And each the silent music heard.<br />
<br />
From heart to heart the glad thoughts flew,<br />
Such sympathy the clasped hands gave,<br />
Her shyness made him timid, too,&mdash;<br />
His daring made her also brave.<br />
<br />
Joy's cup seemed suddenly to brim,<br />
With magic nectar, sweet and rare.<br />
He was so glad she walked by him;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>She was so glad that he was there.<br />
<br />
With silent lips and hearts aglow,<br />
They entered on life's Primrose way.<br />
Then, moved to speech, he cried out, "Oh!<br />
I think it's beautiful to-day!"<br />
<br />
She looked, unheeding, at the skies,<br />
She gazed, unseeing, at the blue;<br />
Then glancing straight into his eyes,<br />
She softly said, "Oh, I do, too!"<br />
<br />
A glory fell on each young brow,<br />
As, through an ever-widening rift<br />
Between the days of Then and Now,<br />
Shone promise of Life's fairest gift.<br />

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
